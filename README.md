# CSS_Bootstrap

## Description

We worked with Bootstrap CSS Framework, [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), create a mobile responsive portfolio. In order to properly format and link the files created together, three different html workspaces were created utilizing the program Visual Studio Code. 

All the workspaces utilized a navigation bar that ran across the top of the page. Using Bootstrap, an interactive navigation bar was pulled to work with a mobile phone as well. An About, Portfolio, and Contact page were all created. 

In the About section, an image is shown along with some filler text that can be changed once a biography is built. The Portfolio section showcases five different portfolio images that will eventually have a responsive link where the header was placed. The Contact section utilized a form in order to have a user send a message with their name and email address information attached.

## Installation

In order to start creating a more accessible website, downloading Visual Studio Code is necessary. Simply go to their website at [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) . You can follow the steps to download on Windows or Mac. Once the program is downloaded, you can transfer files in to start working on the html and css workspaces.

No installation is needed for utilizing Bootstrap, just simply go to [a link](https://getbootstrap.com/) to and make sure to copy the CSS link for all the formatting to work!
